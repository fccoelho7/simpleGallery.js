## Flow

When you send images and is returned a JSON data, it is saved in hidden input value. Same occurs when you edit title, reorder and remove images. After all actions, you just need to save that JSON in your database submitting the form.

## Dependencies

To reorder gallery, is required [Sortable](https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable), "a minimalist JavaScript library".

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install simple-gallery-js --save-dev
```

Or bower, too.

```
bower install simple-gallery-js --save-dev
```

If you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/fccoelho7/simpleGallery.js/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

First, include the script located on the `dist` folder.

```html
<script src="dist/simple-gallery.min.js"></script>
```

Now, you need to instantiate it.

```js
new SimpleGallery('.form-upload');
```

# Usage

When you upload images, your server needs to return a JSON data like:

```json
  [{ "url": "http://../image1.jpg" }, { "url": "http://../image2.jpg" }, ..]
```

Every data will be saved into a value of any hidden input, by default:

```html
  <input type="hidden" name="gallery">
```

Lastly, you also need to create a div that will contain the gallery.

```html
  <div class="gallery-container"></div>
```

If you are not happy with default, change it!

```js
// 1. Form container.
// 2. Name of hidden input that will receive gallery data.
// 3. Gallery container.

new SimpleGallery('.form-upload', 'gallery', '.gallery-container');
```

## Cheat

```html
<form class="form-upload" action="/" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="hidden" name="gallery">
  <label>Image Gallery</label>
  <div class="input-upload btn">
    Upload
    <input class="upload" type="file" multiple="multiple" accept="image/*">
  </div>
  <div class="gallery-container"></div>
</form>
```

## Advanced Options

If you don't want use same URL for upload images, add a `data-action-gallery`.

```html
<form class="form-upload" action="/" method="POST" data-action-gallery='/upload' enctype="multipart/form-data"></form>
```
